## Overview
This code uses a neural network to help a company to predict whether a borrower will repay their student loan. It also includes a discussion around creating a recommendation system for student loans.

## Functionality Implemented
* Jupyter Lab
* Installs and library imports: keras-tuner, pandas, tensor flow, sklearn, and pathlib
* Functions: pd.read_csv, dtypes, train_test_split, StandardScaler, len, columns, Sequential(), model.add, model.summary, model.compile, model.fit, model.evaluate, Path, model.save, load_model, predict, pd.DataFrame, round, classification_report

## Set Up
* The files wihtin the neural-network-challenge repo were updated using Python version 3.10.14, in Google Colab. To run it, please download the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a code editor that runs Python ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac), etc.). 
## Run Instructions:
In Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows):
* Ensure that you're running the correct version of Python (see Set Up above)
* Ensure that you're in the directory containing the file before running
* The program will create and analyse the accuracy of each model, and summarize the results.
